# Service Plane

Let's install a "Service Plane" for users!


## LibreChat!

First, let's deploy LibreChat as a way to talk to our agents.

Steps:
1. Follow the instructions at https://www.librechat.ai/docs/local/helm_chart#configuration to generate credentials for a fresh Helm Chart-based installation of Librechat
2. Create a new `Secret` file with the given credentials and apply it to your cluster. Use `librechat-credentials-env` as the name and `librechat` as the namespace.
3. Apply the prepared ConfigMap to let LibreChat know how to find our agents. Note you might need to change the name of the ConfigMap if the pod ends up not starting:

```bash
kubectl apply -k steps/05-user-serving-plane/librechat/
```

4. Install the LibreChat helm chart with the included `values.yaml` file

```bash
# install Helm
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-4 | bash

# install LibreChat
helm install librechat oci://ghcr.io/danny-avila/librechat-chart/librechat --values steps/05-user-serving-plane/librechat/values.yaml --namespace librechat
```

5. Open a port-forward and talk to the models!

And yes, you will need to register with a fake email first.
